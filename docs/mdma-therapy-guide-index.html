<section id="Effects-of-MDMA-therapy">
  <h2>Effects of MDMA therapy</h2>
  <p>MDMA therapy is used and proven to be very effective in healing emotional trauma, like PTSD, CPTSD, Anxiety disorder and lighter forms of trauma.<br>MDMA is being researched to help with Depression, Addiction, Eating disorder, Relation therapy<br><br>MDMA works by boosting levels of neurotransmitters, like serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. The rise in neurotransmitters creates a sense of emotional openness, compassion, and connection, making it easier for people to confront and process difficult experiences. This neurochemical shift supports a state of empathy and trust, both toward oneself and others, which is crucial in trauma processing.<br><br>Research highlights that MDMA therapy typically requires just one to three sessions to yield long-term results. Unlike traditional treatments, which may require years of therapy, MDMA therapy often leads to sustained improvement. Participants frequently report relief from trauma symptoms and a greater sense of emotional stability, even years after treatment.</p>

  <h2>How to do a session</h2>
  <p></p>
</section>

<section id="Before-the-session">
  <h3>Before the session</h3>
  <p>Do not eat 4 hours before the session. Do not consume coffee the day before and on the day of the trip, MDMA increases the heartbeat a little bit, combining MDMA with coffee is not a good plan.<br>Set a positive intention before the session. Something in the line of "I want to be more open" or "I want to take better care of myself". This helps guide the session in a positive direction.<br>Taking some magnesium will help reduce tension on your jaw muscles, MDMA tends to stiffen these during and after the trip.</p>
</section>

<section id="During-the-session">
  <h3>During the session</h3>
  <p>Lay down, eye mask on, relax and let your body come with what you are ready to heal or process. There is enormous wisdom in your body, it knows how to heal.<br>Limit your speaking and thinking, allow yourself to go inside and feel into your body. Embrace every emotion that you encounter.<br><br>Events that happened in your past can not be changed by thinking. Honor the effect the events had on you and accept the emotions that they triggered in you.<br>Embrace the part of you that is stuck in the past with a blanket of love in the now. Acceptance is helpful.<br><br>Limit the amount you drink, MDMA can make some people thirsty, which can lead to drinking too much water. Set a flask with the max you can drink helps to monitor your fluid intake.<br>Also keep an eye on the body temperature. For some people this can get too high. Monitor and cool the body if this happens.<br>Having a teeth protector at hand can be helpful when encountering anger during the session. Clenching jaws are not uncommon. Combined with the tight jaws caused by the MDMA teeth protectors can be necessary to prevent tooth damage.</p>
</section>

<section id="After-the-session">
  <h3>After the session</h3>
  <p>Just after the trip drink a glass of water with electrolytes. This helps restore the minerals in your body and eases the comedown.<br>Do not drive or take public transport on your own on the day after the trip. You will not be fit to drive a car.<br>Some people encounter difficulty to sleep after a session, MDMA will still be active in your body.<br><br>If you can, it is helpful to keep the day off after a session. Time is needed to integrate all that was experienced.<br>Also the MDMA has a relative long comedown, the effect of the trip will still be noticeable that day.<br><br>Listening to the music that was played during the session can help integrate adn deepen the effect of the session.<br>Many insights and extra processing of emotions happen not only during but also after the trip.</p>
</section>

<section id="Setting">
  <h3>Setting</h3>
  <p>Using MDMA in a therapeutic setting all has to do with dosage and setting. MDMA can be used as a party drug, it is the main substance in XTC, but that does not heal the users.<br>The emotional healing is achieved when a person focuses his or her attention inside, with eyes closed, listening to supporting music in a safe and trusted environment.<br>An MDMA therapy session normally takes 6 to 8 hours where the user lays down on a bed or mattress. The eye mask helps to go inside and music plays a big role in guiding the participant.</p>
</section>

<section id="Music">
  <h3>Music</h3>
  <p>Many playlists that help set the right ambiance for MDMA therapy can be found on spotify. Some are soothing and slow paced, others quite upbeat. Preferences apparently vary a lot. This playlist is a curated list specific for MDMA therapy:<br><br><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5ZNWNSOpcUS71b8WLRR1qu?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></p>
</section>

<section id="Dosage">
  <h3>Dosage</h3>
  <p>Standard dosage that is used in a session is 100 to 180 mg of MDMA or 5-MAPB.<br>The actual dosage guideline is 0.7 to 1.2 mg per KG body weight.<br><br>In the US, split dose is often used: 120 mg at start and then 60 mg around an hour later.<br>In the Netherlands standard dosage that we observed being used is 100 mg.<br><br>Dosage can vary wildly depending on personal sensitivity ranging from 25 up to 250 mg.<br><br>250 mg is an absolute maximum (although some people may be able to handle more without adverse physical side effects). A woman is reported to have died from a 300 mg dose.<br><br>What happens if you take a higher dose than what fits with your sensitivity?<br>There is a dosage range where mdma is effective as a therapeutic substance.<br>When taking too much the body is flooded with serotonin and no therapeutic work can be done. All feels like love, rainbows and unicorns.<br>When the effect of the MDMA wears off the user automatically comes in the therapeutic effective range. The effect of the MDMA will be felt for a longer time, but that is the only side effect.</p>
</section>

<section id="MDMA-Analog">
  <h3>MDMA Analog</h3>
  <p>Next to MDMA there exist MDMA analogues that work similar to MDMA.<br>An analog is a modification of a substance, mostly consisting of just one atom difference with the original.<br>The analogs have a slightly different effect in the body, some of these even being more suitable than MDMA for MDMA therapy.<br><br>MDMA Analogs that are used in MDMA therapy are:<br><br>5-MAPB is used in the Netherlands for MDMA therapy as it is (still) a legal alternative. Less endorphin is released compared to MDMA, giving less of an aroused effect, making it a very suitable for therapeutic sessions.<br><br>6-ABP shares empathogenic and stimulant effects with MDMA but has a longer duration and slightly different psychoactive profile.</p>
</section>

<section id="Tripsitter">
  <h3>Tripsitter</h3>
  <p>A tripsitter plays a vital role in ensuring the participant's safety, comfort, and overall well-being.<br>This can be a therapist or a trusted person. During the session many will want to share the experiences they have.<br><br>The tripsitter listens without judgment or pity to anything the participant expresses during the session. This includes emotions, thoughts, memories, or insights that arise under the influence of MDMA. <br>The tripsitter serves as a calming and stabilizing influence, helping the participant feel safe to explore their inner experience.<br>If the participant encounters difficult emotions or traumatic memories, the tripsitter provides calmness, support and helps the person navigate the experience without suppressing it.</p>
</section>

<section id="Time-in-between-sessions">
  <h3>Time in between sessions</h3>
  <p>There is a general consensus that significant time between MDMA (or MDMA analogon) consumption is needed. Taking too much, too often, can lead to serotonin poisoning of the body.<br><br>Also clear is that the exact time that is needed in between sessions is an educated guess.<br>The MAPS organisation’s guideline is 6 weeks in between sessions.<br>Others keep 2 months or even longer as a safe interval.<br>Some keep this guideline: maximum 3 trips per half year.<br>All of these guidelines have been proven to work, anything shorter than the above is not advised.</p>

<section id="When-not-to-do-MDMA-therapy">
  <h2>When not to do MDMA therapy</h2>
  <p>MDMA therapy can be a powerful tool for personal growth and healing. However, it is not suitable or safe for everyone.<br><br>If you’re on any medication, whether prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplement: verify its safety with a healthcare professional before exploring MDMA therapy.<br>If any of the following apply to you, do not proceed with MDMA therapy without consulting a qualified healthcare professional:<br><br><b>Younger Than 18 Years</b><br>Adolescents under 18 are vulnerable to MDMA’s neurotoxic effects due to brain development still being in progress.<br><br><b>History of Psychosis or Bipolar Disorder</b><br>Individuals with a history of psychotic episodes, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, or certain mood disorders may be at higher risk of adverse reactions.<br><br><b>Combined Usage with Other drugs</b><br>Combining with other drugs that effect serotonin levels can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Psilocybin (magic mushroom) and LSD are considered safe combinations.<br><br><b>Serious Heart, Liver, or Kidney Conditions</b><br>MDMA can elevate heart rate and blood pressure, putting extra strain on these organs. People with preexisting cardiac, hepatic, or renal issues should avoid MDMA therapy.<br><br><b>Pregnancy or Breastfeeding</b><br>The effects of MDMA on fetal development or nursing infants are not well studied. It is generally advised to avoid any nonessential medications or substances during these times.<br><br><b>Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs)</b><br>Examples: Fluoxetine (Prozac), Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil), Venlafaxine (Effexor), Amitriptyline (Elavil)<br>Many antidepressants affect serotonin levels in the brain. Combining them with MDMA’s strong serotonergic effect can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.<br><br><b>MAO Inhibitors (MAOIs)</b><br>Examples: Phenelzine (Nardil), Tranylcypromine (Parnate)<br>MAOIs also regulate the breakdown of neurotransmitters. Mixing MAOIs with MDMA can dangerously intensify or prolong MDMA’s effects, leading to severe cardiovascular and neurological risks.<br><br><b>Certain Anxiety Medications (Benzodiazepines)</b><br>Examples: Alprazolam (Xanax), Diazepam (Valium), Lorazepam (Ativan)<br>While not typically linked to serotonin levels, taking MDMA with benzodiazepines can complicate the body’s response, potentially masking or altering effects and presenting unknown risks.<br><br><b>Stimulant Medications (ADHD Medications)</b><br>Examples: Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), Amphetamine salts (Adderall)<br>Adding MDMA (another stimulant) on top of existing stimulant therapy can overload the cardiovascular system, raising blood pressure and heart rate to unsafe levels.<br><br><b>Over-the-Counter Medications and Supplements</b><br>Examples: Certain cold and cough medicines (especially those with dextromethorphan), weight-loss supplements containing stimulants, or high doses of 5-HTP/tryptophan<br>Even readily available products can contain compounds that interact with serotonin pathways or increase stimulant load, thus elevating risks when combined with MDMA.<br><br><b>Blood Pressure or Heart Medications</b><br>Examples: Beta-blockers (propranolol), ACE inhibitors (lisinopril), Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine)<br>MDMA can raise blood pressure and heart rate. If you have a cardiovascular condition or are on related medications, the additional strain may lead to dangerous complications.</p>
