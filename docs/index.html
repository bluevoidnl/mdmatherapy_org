  <h2>MDMA therapy</h2>
  <p>Heal your emotions that are stuck in the past.<br>That will heal your body and calm your thoughts.<br>With the silence that then remains, you can experience what you really are.<br><br>You are not your body, not your emotions, not your thoughts.<br>You are a soul (the self), a soul that has a body, has emotions and has thoughts</p>
</section>

<section id="Disclaimer">
  <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
  <p>MDMA is illegal in almost all countries of the world. Some countries allow MDMA usage in therapeutical setting.<br>We do not advice you or want to seduce you to break the law and get in trouble in that way.<br>Please adhere to your local laws!<br>There are some alternative substances that might be legal in your country. For a list of alternatives see the section "MDMA-analoog".</p>

<section id="Effects-of-MDMA-therapy">
  <h2>Effects of MDMA therapy</h2>
  <p>MDMA therapy is used and proven to be very effective in healing emotional trauma, like PTSD, CPTSD, Anxiety disorder and lighter forms of trauma.<br>MDMA is being researched to help with Depression, Addiction, Eating disorder, Relation therapy<br><br>MDMA works by boosting levels of neurotransmitters, like serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. This gives the user a feeling of safety and trust inside, in which formerly overwhelming emotions can be processed.<br><br>The rise in oxytocin creates a sense of emotional openness, compassion, and connection, making it easier for people to confront and discuss difficult experiences. This neurochemical shift supports a state of empathy and trust, both toward oneself and others, which is crucial in trauma processing.<br><br>Research highlights that MDMA therapy typically requires just one to three sessions to yield long-term results. Unlike traditional treatments, which may require years of therapy, MDMA therapy often leads to sustained improvement. Participants frequently report relief from trauma symptoms and a greater sense of emotional stability, even years after treatment.</p>

<section id="How-to-do-a-session">
  <h2>How to do a session</h2>
  <p></p>
</section>

<section id="Before-the-session">
  <h3>Before the session</h3>
  <p>Do not eat 4 hours before the session. Do not consume coffee the day before and on the day of the trip, MDMA increases the heartbeat a little bit, combining MDMA with coffee is not a good plan.<br>Set a positive intention before the session. Something in the line of "I want to be more open" or "I want to take better care of myself". This helps guide the session in a positive direction.</p>
</section>

<section id="During-the-session">
  <h3>During the session</h3>
  <p>Limit the amount you drink, MDMA can make some people thirsty, which can lead to drinking too much water. Set a flask with the max you can drink helps to monitor your fluid intake.<br>Also keep an eye on the body temperature. For some people this can get too high. Monitor and cool the body if this happens.</p>
</section>

<section id="After-the-session">
  <h3>After the session</h3>
  <p>Just after the trip drink electrolytes, this helps restore the minerals in your body and eases the comedown.<br>Do not drive or take public transport on your own on the day after the trip. You will not be fit to drive a car.<br>If you can it is helpful to keep the day off after a session. Time is needed to integrate all that was experienced.<br>Also the MDMA has a long comedown, the effect of the trip will still be noticeable that day.</p>
</section>

<section id="Setting">
  <h3>Setting</h3>
  <p>Using MDMA in a therapeutic setting all has to do with dosage and setting. Mdma is used in many countries as a party drug, it is the main substance in XTC.<br>A whole different effect than the party part is achieved when a person is focusing their attention inside, with eyes closed, not talking and listening to supporting music in a safe and trusted environment.<br>An MDMA therapy session normally takes 6 to 8 hours where the user lays down. An eye mask to helps to go inside and music plays a big role in guiding.</p>
</section>

<section id="Music">
  <h3>Music</h3>
  <p>Many playlists that help set the right ambiance for MDMA therapy can be found on spotify. Some are soothing and slow paced, others quite upbeat. Preferences apparently vary a lot. This playlist is a curated list specific for MDMA therapy:<br><br><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5ZNWNSOpcUS71b8WLRR1qu?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></p>
</section>

<section id="Dosage">
  <h3>Dosage</h3>
  <p>Standard dosage that is used in a session is 100 to 180 mg of MDMA or 5MAPB.<br>The actual dosage guideline is 0.7 to 1.2 mg per KG body weight.<br><br>In the US, split dose is often used: 120 mg at start and then 60 mg around an hour later.<br>In the Netherlands standard dosage that we observed being used is 100 mg.<br><br>Dosage can vary wildly depending on personal sensitivity ranging from 25 up to 250 mg.<br><br>250 mg is an absolute maximum (although some people may be able to handle more without adverse physical side effects). A woman is reported to have died from a 300 mg dose.<br><br>What happens if you take a higher dose than what fits with your sensitivity?<br>There is a dosage range where mdma is effective as a therapeutic substance.<br>When taking too much the body is flooded with serotonin and no therapeutic work can be done. All feels like love, rainbows and unicorns.<br>When the effect of the MDMA wears off the user automatically comes in the therapeutic effective range. The effect of the MDMA will be felt for a longer time, but that is the only side effect.</p>
</section>

<section id="MDMA-Analogon">
  <h3>MDMA Analogon</h3>
  <p>Next to MDMA there exist MDMA analogues that work similar to MDMA.<br>An analogon is a modification of a substance, mostly consisting of just one atom difference with the original.<br>The analogous have a slightly different effect in the body, some of these even being more suitable than MDMA for MDMA therapy.<br><br>MDMA Analogons that are used in MDMA therapy are:<br><br>5MAPB is used in the Netherlands for MDMA therapy as it is (still) a legal alternative. Less endorphin is released compared to MDMA, giving less of an aroused effect, making it a very suitable for therapeutic sessions.<br><br>6ABP shares empathogenic and stimulant effects with MDMA but has a longer duration and slightly different psychoactive profile.</p>
</section>

<section id="Tripsitter">
  <h3>Tripsitter</h3>
  <p>A tripsitter plays a vital role in ensuring the participant's safety, comfort, and overall well-being.<br>This can be a therapist or a trusted person. During the session many will want to share the experiences they have.<br><br>The tripsitter listens without judgment or pity to anything the participant expresses during the session. This includes emotions, thoughts, memories, or insights that arise under the influence of MDMA. <br>The tripsitter serves as a calming and stabilizing influence, helping the participant feel safe to explore their inner experience.<br>If the participant encounters difficult emotions or traumatic memories, the tripsitter provides calmness, support and helps the person navigate the experience without suppressing it.</p>
</section>

<section id="Time-in-between-sessions">
  <h3>Time in between sessions</h3>
  <p>There is a general consensus that significant time between MDMA (or MDMA analogon) consumption is needed. Taking too much, too often, can lead to serotonin poisoning of the body.<br><br>Also clear is that the exact time that is needed in between sessions is an educated guess.<br>The MAPS organisation’s guideline is 6 weeks in between sessions.<br>Others keep 2 months or even longer as a safe interval.<br>Some keep this guideline: maximum 3 trips per half year.<br>All of these guidelines have been proven to work, anything shorter than the above is not advised.</p>
</section>

<section id="Contra-indications">
  <h2>Contra indications</h2>
  <p>MDMA should not be used by persons under 18 years old. Adolescents under 18 are particularly vulnerable to MDMA’s neurotoxic effects due to brain development still being in progress.<br><br>Anti depressants do not go well with MDMA.</p>
